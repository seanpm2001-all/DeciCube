# The DeciCube

**Short for:** `The "Decillion cube"`

**Proposed by:** `Sean Patrick Myrick (@seanpm2001)` **on:** `2022, Thursday, January 27th at 22:25:28 (10:25:28 pm PST)`

_A computer that can hold at least 1 billion copies of the entire Internet (as of 2022, Thursday, January 27th) and fit inside a single datacenter, or a single 3 meter by 3 meter brick (expanded to a 300 meter by 300 meter brick, or a 3 kilometer by 3 kilometer brick, due to logical and theoretical limitations)_

## Statistics

**Estimated cost:** `at least $1b USD` **o:r** `at least $1t USD`

**Compatible file systems:** `ZFS`, `openZFS`

**System type:** `Quantum computer storage-based device`

**Size:** **somewhere between:** `3x3x0.5 meters`, **and** `3x3x0.5 kilometers`

**Compatible operating systems:** `Linux`, `UNIX-like`, `other ZFS/OpenZFS-compatible operating systems`

**Storage capacity:** `~500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes (~500 Nonillion bytes, or ~500.00 geopbytes)`

## Grain of sand formula

* ~50,000,000,000,000,000,000 (50 quintillion)

* ~3.8461538461538463e+18 atoms in a grain of sand

* 1 grain of sand = 1/1000 grams

* ~50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms in 1 gram (50 sextillion)

* ~50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms in 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) (50 septillion)

* ~50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms in 1 megagram (~1.102 tons) (50 octillion)

* ~50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms in 1 gigagram (~1.02 megatons) (50 nonillion)

* ~50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms in 1 teragram (~1.02 gigatons) (50 decillion)

## Legend

* It is estimated that 1 bit of memory can fit into ~13 atoms of space, so a single byte can fit in ~104 atoms of space

* 1 grain of sand is estimated to be 1/1000 of a gram, the largest size estimate of a grain of sand was used, as not all sand weighs the same.

* 1 b = 1 (one)

* 1 kb = 1k (thousand)

* 1 mb = 1m (million)

* 1 gb = 1b (billion)

* 1 tb = 1t (trillion)

* 1 pb = 1q (quadtillion)

* 1 exb = 1Q (quintillion)

* 1 zeb = 1s (sextillion)

* 1 yob = 1S (sepillion)

* 1 bb = 1o (1,000 yottabytes, 1 brontobyte) (octillion)

* 1 gpb = 1n (1,000,000 yottabytes, 1 geopbyte) (nonillion)

* 1,000 gpb = 1d (1,000,000,000 yottabytes, 1,000 geopbytes) (decillion)

* Gigagram is a metric term I coined that adds computer analogy to expand the metric system. It is equal to 1,000 kilograms)

* 1 Teragram is also a metric term I coined. It is equal to 1,000 gigagrams.

* The term "gigaton" may not have previously existed, but is defined here as being equivalent to 1,000 megatons.
